## Projects
### Build Document Q&A With Advance RAG
[See Project](https://github.com/r3jen/document_qna_demo)

a Q&A document to provide comprehensive guidance on Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) in banking. This document serves as a structured reference for addressing frequently asked questions (FAQs) related to compliance, risk management, transaction processing, customer service protocols, and regulatory requirements. By ensuring clarity and accessibility, this Q&A document helps employees navigate complex banking procedures efficiently while maintaining regulatory compliance.

### Build AI Agent Internal Auditor

I have developed an AI agent with a structured three-stage process: (1) Data Collection & Initial Analysis, where the AI performs data crawling, information extraction, and preprocessing; (2) Analysis & Processing, leveraging machine learning, NLP, or graph analysis to detect patterns and anomalies; and (3) Decision & Automation, where the AI generates insights, recommendations, or automates processes such as AML detection, fraud prevention, and ICOFR risk control to enhance operational efficiency and regulatory compliance.

### Social Media Listening

I have worked on a Social Media Listening Project that focuses on real-time monitoring, sentiment analysis, and trend detection across various social media platforms, including X (formerly Twitter), Facebook, Telegram, and Google. This project leverages AI-driven NLP and machine learning models to analyze public conversations, detect emerging topics, and identify potential risks such as brand reputation threats, fraudulent activities, and regulatory violations. By implementing automated data crawling, entity recognition, and anomaly detection, this system enables organizations to gain actionable insights for decision-making, crisis management, and fraud detection.

## Projects
- #### Build Document Q&A With Advance RAG
  [See Project](https://github.com/r3jen/document_qna_demo)
  a Q&A document to provide comprehensive guidance on Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) in banking. This document serves as a structured reference for addressing frequently asked questions (FAQs) related to compliance, risk management, transaction processing, customer   service protocols, and regulatory requirements. By ensuring clarity and accessibility, this Q&A document helps employees navigate complex banking procedures efficiently while maintaining regulatory compliance.


- #### Build AI Agent Internal Auditor

  I developed an AI agent with a three-stage process: (1) Data Collection (crawling, extraction), (2) Pattern Detection (ML, NLP, graph analysis), and (3) Decision Automation (AML, fraud prevention, ICOFR) to enhance efficiency and compliance.


- #### Social Media Listening

  I built a Social Media Listening system for real-time monitoring, sentiment analysis, and risk detection across X, Facebook, Telegram, and Google, leveraging AI-driven NLP and ML to analyze conversations, detect fraud, and enhance decision-making.

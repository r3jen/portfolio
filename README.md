# Sr Data Scientist

#### Technical Skills: Python, SQL, Google Cloud Platform, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence

## Education
- Bachelor's Degree, System Information | The University of Gunadarma (_May 2011_)								       		

## Work Experience
**Sr Data Scientist @ Bank Jago (_June 2021 - Present_)**
- I have experience in fraud detection, including judol detection by crawling data from Google, X (formerly Twitter), and Telegram, as well as identifying account trading activities through Facebook, Telegram, and X. Additionally, I have worked on transaction network analytics using Python NetworkX, face swap detection with deep learning, and emulator detection leveraging deep learning techniques
- I am also capable of developing AI agents to assist in ICOFR (Internal Control Over Financial Reporting) risk control analysis, enabling automated identification of control gaps, anomaly detection in financial transactions, and risk assessment. By leveraging machine learning and natural language processing, these AI agents can analyze financial reports, transaction patterns, and internal audit findings to enhance compliance and mitigate risks
- I have experience in developing AML (Anti-Money Laundering) rules for banks, focusing on detecting suspicious transaction patterns, account behavior anomalies, and compliance violations. By leveraging data analytics, machine learning, and rule-based detection models, I have worked on enhancing transaction monitoring systems, identifying high-risk customers, and automating AML reporting to ensure regulatory compliance

**Data Science Instructor @ Data Science Solution  (_June 2022 - Present_)**
- Focused on teaching Machine Learning, Big Data Analytics, and Natural Language Processing (NLP), guiding students through real-world projects, model development, and data-driven decision-making.
- I specialize in building AI agents for automated decision-making, risk assessment, and fraud detection, integrating AI-driven solutions into business and financial applications.

## Projects
### Build Document Q&A With Advance RAG
[See Project](https://github.com/r3jen/document_qna_demo)

a Q&A document to provide comprehensive guidance on Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) in banking. This document serves as a structured reference for addressing frequently asked questions (FAQs) related to compliance, risk management, transaction processing, customer service protocols, and regulatory requirements. By ensuring clarity and accessibility, this Q&A document helps employees navigate complex banking procedures efficiently while maintaining regulatory compliance.

### Build AI Agent Internal Auditor

I have developed an AI agent with a structured three-stage process: (1) Data Collection & Initial Analysis, where the AI performs data crawling, information extraction, and preprocessing; (2) Analysis & Processing, leveraging machine learning, NLP, or graph analysis to detect patterns and anomalies; and (3) Decision & Automation, where the AI generates insights, recommendations, or automates processes such as AML detection, fraud prevention, and ICOFR risk control to enhance operational efficiency and regulatory compliance.

### Social Media Listening

I have worked on a Social Media Listening Project that focuses on real-time monitoring, sentiment analysis, and trend detection across various social media platforms, including X (formerly Twitter), Facebook, Telegram, and Google. This project leverages AI-driven NLP and machine learning models to analyze public conversations, detect emerging topics, and identify potential risks such as brand reputation threats, fraudulent activities, and regulatory violations. By implementing automated data crawling, entity recognition, and anomaly detection, this system enables organizations to gain actionable insights for decision-making, crisis management, and fraud detection.
